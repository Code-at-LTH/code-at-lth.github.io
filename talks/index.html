    Talks can be anything from 5 minutes to an hour. It can have whatever format you want: slides, code along, or simply talking without any tool.

    The hardest part is to find speakers, we try to actively find speakers but we hope that people will see the value in it and try to contribute themselves by holding a talk to give back to the community.

<h3>How large will the audience be?</h3>
<p>
    As large as you want it to, but in the near future we aim for 50-100 people per event (if that sounds too intimidating: talk to us and we'll figure something out). If you want an even larger audience (great!) we might be able to arrange a recording of it and upload it to YouTube.
