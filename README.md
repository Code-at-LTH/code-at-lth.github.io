# Code@LTH Website
The official Code@LTH website.

It currently lives at [code-at-lth.github.io/](http://code-at-lth.github.io/).

This site will likely live on [code.lth.se](http://code.lth.se) when it is mature.

### Development
If you want to help develop the site, clone it and start a simple HTTP server locally. This can be easily by being in the project directory and running `python3 -m http.server`.
