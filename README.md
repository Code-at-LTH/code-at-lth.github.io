# Code@LTH Website
The official Code@LTH website.

It currently lives at [code-at-lth.github.io/](http://code-at-lth.github.io/). There is also a shortcut up at [lth.se/code](http://lth.se/code).

This site might live on [code.lth.se](http://code.lth.se) or something similar when it is mature.

### Development
If you want to help develop the site, download and install [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) which this site uses for static page generation.
The Jekyll docs should describe well how to use it.
Whenever a new commit is made with the project files GitHub automatically updates the site (might take a few minutes).

If you have any issues getting things up and running, contact an existing contributor.

**Note:** Always test your changes locally before pushing.
If you have issues with pages not rendering properly ensure you don't have a 
[BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) at the start of the related file. 
An example of a breaking such commit can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-at-LTH/code-at-lth.github.io/commit/350f0b34613464f8596203ce5dfb883fab0ba82f).
