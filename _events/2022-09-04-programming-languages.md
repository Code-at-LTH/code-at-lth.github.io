This is a lecture part of the introduction (nollning) for new students studying Computer Science at LTH.

You will learn about some popular programming languages, and the main differences between them, and why you might want to use multiple programming languages when building a product. You will see some example code and examples of how a standard web stack can look like.

There is some merit to learning languages and frameworks well, but it's also a good idea to find new techniques and new features in other languages to be able to pick good tools for your next project. There is no language that is optimal at every task!

At the end we will introduce a problem solving site - [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com). Here you can solve small programming problems in many different languages, which we encourage.
