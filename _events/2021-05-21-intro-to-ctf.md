What is a CTF competition? Is it the way to become a hacker? 

You will find the answers to these questions and more in this lecture by Code@LTH! We will give an intro to, among other things, web hacking and cryptography and finish up with a few demos. 

The lecture will be held in Swedish at Code@LTH's discord server: [https://discord.gg/NpnXYj4](https://discord.gg/NpnXYj4).
