### About NCPC

NCPC is an annual 5 hour contest where your team are given 8-13 algorithmic problems to solve.

The problems vary greatly in difficulty, from beginner level to extremely hard.

Solve each problem by:
- Writing a program in one of the [supported programming languages](https://open.kattis.com/help)
- Test it locally on your computer with the sample test cases
- Submit it to the online judge system [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com).
- Wait for the results on the secret test cases.

Kattis will tell you if your program:
- Was Correct (Accepted)
- Produced the wrong output (Wrong Answer)
- Ran too slow (Time Limit Exceeded)
- Crashed (Run Time Error)

If you submit a program which is not correct, but you later in the contest solve the problem, you receive some penalty time for the incorrect attempt.

At LTH this contest is used as the qualifier for the regional contest [NWERC](https://www.nwerc.eu). The top student teams that are ICPC-eligible will advance to NWERC.

The contest was created in Lund in 1991 by Roy Andersson at the department of Computer Science at Lund University, and has since been organized yearly. In 1996 it became the Swedish Championships, and in 2011 it became the Nordic Championships. At [http://cs.lth.se/contest/](http://cs.lth.se/contest/) information, images and previous scoreboards are archived.

Your team is ICPC-eligible (can compete in the student contest) if all team members fulfills the following criteria:
- Born in 1998 or later
- Started studying at Lund University 2017 or later
- Is still enrolled at Lund University.

If these criteria does not hold for all team members, your team instead participate in the open contest.

The full rules can be found at the official [NCPC 2021 website](https://nordic.icpc.io/ncpc2021#rules).

### Tips

If you have not previously participated in NCPC a great way to prepare is to have a look at the [problems from last year](https://ncpc20.kattis.com/problems). Solve the problems ordered by how many people solved them during the contest - marked by green on the [scoreboard](https://ncpc20.kattis.com/standings). For example last year 192 teams solved problem M, but no teams solved problem L.
