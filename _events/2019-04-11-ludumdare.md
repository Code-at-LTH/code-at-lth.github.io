# Ludum Dare

Ludum Dare is an international game jam organized independently and Code@LTH are holding a local hub where you get up to 72 hours to work on a game based on a theme (revealed right at the start), alone or with friends. We encourage people who make art/music/other to also come, all types of creative can go into a game! 

More information about the upcoming **Ludum Dare 44** can be found on [this blog post](/blog/2019/03/31/ludumdare).
