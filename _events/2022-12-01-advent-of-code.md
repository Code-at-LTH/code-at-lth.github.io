Join us to code on the advent calendar [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/), drink julmust and eat gingerbread cookies!

We will demo some problems from last year, and then help you out solving the first problems from this year.

### About Advent of code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar with a programming puzzle (in two parts) each day until Christmas!

Advent of Code starts already the _1st of December 06:00 (UTC+1)_.

Each day's puzzle is released at 6 a.m. You can choose how seriously you participate. Some solve the problem when they get up. Others when they get home in the evening. There is a global leaderboard per day where the 100 who solve the problem the fastest get points. If you want to make it and get global points, you need to adjust your diurnal rhythm and get up at 05:30, make coffee and be ready when the puzzle is released!

You can also create your own leaderboard and compete against your friends (or just encourage each other to solve the problems every day!)

Code@LTH has its own leaderboard which you can join with the following code: `107707-7795f557` at [https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/private](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/private).
