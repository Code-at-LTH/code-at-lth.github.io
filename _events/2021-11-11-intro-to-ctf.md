What is a Capture The Flag (CTF) competition? Is it the way to become a hacker?

You will find the answers to these questions and more in this lecture by Code@LTH! You will learn some common techniques used in web hacking and cryptography. We will also demo some problems.

Capture the Flag is a security contest where you solve security related problems. Often the goal is to gain access to find a hidden text string, called a flag. Usually solving and finding the flags include exploiting some kind of vulnerability in a system, that could very much have been a real system. By solving these kinds of problems, and participating in CTFs you learn to look for and discover vulnerabilities, basically trying out to be a penetration-tester.
