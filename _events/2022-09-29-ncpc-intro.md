The Nordic Collegiate Programming Contest ([NCPC](https://nordic.icpc.io/ncpc2022/)) will take place the 8th of October. It is the Nordic championships in competitive programming for university teams.

To prepare, we will host a beginner friendly introduction lecture followed by a practice competition the 29th of September.

The lecture will start at 17:15 and you will learn how the NCPC works, what kind of problems to expect, and see a demo where we solving a problem live.

Between 18:00 and 20:00 the [practice contest](https://open.kattis.com/contests/x9fb4p) will be run at the online judge system Kattis, which also is used at NCPC. 

If you have any questions about Kattis or NCPC, please jump into our [discord server](https://discord.gg/NpnXYj4), and ask. Just remember that during the real NCPC contest you are not allowed to communicate with anyone outside your team!

Remember to register your team for NCPC, deadline: the 5th of October!
