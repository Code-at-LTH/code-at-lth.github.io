The 15th of September we will host a lecture where you'll learn how to find your dream apartment with Python!

The student apartment organisation AFB in Lund only have the new apartments on their website for a couple of days. It's extremely easy to miss your dream apartment if you don't visit their website daily. Visiting their website and looking for apartments is automatable, and we will teach you how! With no prior coding knowledge required we plan to teach you how to write a bot that emails you about new apartments each day!

AFB actually has a hidden API that will make our lives a lot easier when we automate this: [https://www.afbostader.se/redimo/rest/vacantproducts](https://www.afbostader.se/redimo/rest/vacantproducts).

Come visit the event to learn more - guaranteed to be beginner friendly. There will also be some fika!
