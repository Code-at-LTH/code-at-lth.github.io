The Advent calendar Advent of Code starts the _1st of December 06:00 CET_.

Until the 25th of December a **new programming puzzle** is released each day at: [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

Code@LTH has a private leaderboard, where you can compete against other Code@LTH members in solving the puzzles as fast as possible (or perhaps the main competition is about how early you manage to get out of bed). 

Join our leaderboard with the code: `107707-7795f557` at [https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard/private](https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard/private).
