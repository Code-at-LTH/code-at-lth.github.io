## General information
Hash Code is a yearly team programming competition made by Google. 

You are given one optimization problem, which is either very hard or impossible to solve optimally. Instead you should find a solution that maximizes your score.

Join us and participate from our hub, which we have organized yearly since 2016!

There will be fika! And some prizes!

To participate you will have to sign up [here](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode).

Don't forget to mark Code@LTH as your hub when you create your team on the judge system.
