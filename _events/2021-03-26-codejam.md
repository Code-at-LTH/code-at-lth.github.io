The first qualifying round of Google's yearly individual programming contest [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam) takes place the 26th to 27th of March.

We will host an intro event on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/NpnXYj4) to Google Code Jam, where we will demo how to solve last years qualifying contest. After that you can try out to solve this year's problems.

Note that in the qualification round (and only the qualification round) it is allowed to ask for help, and offer help to others on the problems, which means that after the demo we will happily help you out if you get stuck on a problem.
