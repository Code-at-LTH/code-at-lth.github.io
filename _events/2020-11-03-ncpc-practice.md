The Nordic championships in competitive programming (NCPC) will take place the 7th of November. To prepare, we are hosting a practice competition the 3rd of November.

The practice contest will be run at the online judge system Kattis, which also is used at NCPC. You can find the practice contest at the following link: [https://open.kattis.com/contests/yjfiag](https://open.kattis.com/contests/yjfiag)

If you have any questions about Kattis or NCPC, please jump into our [discord server](https://discord.gg/NpnXYj4), and ask. Just remember that during the real NCPC contest you are not allowed to communicate with anyone outside your team.

Remember to register your team for NCPC, deadline: the 4th of November!
