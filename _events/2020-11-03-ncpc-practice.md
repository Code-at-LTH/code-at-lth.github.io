The Nordic championships in competitive programming (NCPC) will take place the 7th of November. To prepare, we are hosting a beginner friendly lecture followed by a practice competition the 3rd of November.

The practice contest will be run at the online judge system Kattis, which also is used at NCPC. You can find the practice contest at the following link: [https://open.kattis.com/contests/yjfiag](https://open.kattis.com/contests/yjfiag)

Remember to register your team for NCPC, deadline: the 4th of November! If you don't have a team yet, showing up for this event is a great way of finding some team members!
