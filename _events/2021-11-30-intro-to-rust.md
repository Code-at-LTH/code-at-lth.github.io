The [rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) seeks to solve several of the problems that have plagued earlier languages for systems development.

Rust has started to become a [very popular choice](https://www.rust-lang.org/production/users) for performance critical projects. It is used inside the Firefox browser, at Dropbox, at ByteDance, and is also being [considered to be used inside the Linux kernel](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/linus-torvalds-weighs-in-on-rust-language-in-the-linux-kernel/) alongside C.

With it's language features rust has managed to bring with it several guaranties, such as the nonexistence of data-races and dangling pointers, while also moving typical runtime errors into the domain of compilation errors. 


If you want to understand how rust can give these guarantees or if you just want some insight into a very interesting language then join our introductory lecture to rust!
