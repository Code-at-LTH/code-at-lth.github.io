Here are a couple of problems where each solution demonstrates some concept that is quite common at programming competitions. For an experienced competitve programmare, who has seen all these techniques before most of these problems would be classified as easy. They are however chosen so that they become a challange for someone who is new to competitive programming. Please move on to the next topic when you've solved a few of these!

Note that your program is tested on secret inputs. Your program has to produce the correct output for all secrets inputs. You can however be sure that the secret inputs follow the input format given in the problem statement.

When your program is not accepted, there can be some different errors, which are described with error codes. I plan to add some tips about the error codes in the future.
