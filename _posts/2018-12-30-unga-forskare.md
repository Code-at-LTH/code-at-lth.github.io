We are happy to announce that we are now part of [Unga Forskare](https://ungaforskare.se/) (together with 40 other organizations for young people related to natural science, technology or mathematics).

They provide us with financial and organizational support, and a membership system. All current members have been transferred there. All we had to do was to edit the csv-format of our membership list, which was easily done with a tiny python script.

We plan to have an annual meeting in late January 2019. MÃ¥ns and Jacob are doing the paperwork during the break. If you are a member, expect an invitation in your mailbox before the 10th of January.
