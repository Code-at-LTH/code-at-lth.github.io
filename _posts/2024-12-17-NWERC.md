The Olympics may have been this summer, but the biggest competition of the year is in the fall — NWERC!

During the semester, both NCPC and NWERC have taken place as part of the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) – the world's largest programming competition for university students, with representation from 3,450 universities in 111 countries.

Here at Lund University, Code@LTH has been proud to host the local NCPC competition, a qualifying event for NWERC. We have taken on this responsibility for many successful years. Participating in NCPC offers qualified contestants a fantastic opportunity: a fully funded trip to the host university, which this year was Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. There, they compete against other top universities from Europe and meet other students passionate about programming.

A huge congratulations to the winning team, Noobs@LTH, consisting of David Stålmarck, Gustav Nilsson Gisleskog, and Julius Thunström, who won NCPC here in Lund and represented us with honor in Delft!

Would you like to be part of this exciting competition next year? NCPC takes place in early October, and more information will be published as the competition approaches. If you’re eager to start training already, you’re very welcome to join our Wednesday training sessions held every week.

For more information and updates, keep an eye on our website and social media.

See you at the next coding event!
