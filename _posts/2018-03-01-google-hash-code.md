The first of March Code@LTH organised, for the 3rd year in a row, a local hub for teams from Lund to compete in Google Hash Code. In total 4800 teams world wide participated this year.

We had about 70 on site participants, organised in 21 teams. We filled up E:1406 for a short introduction, and Google's live stream. Then everybody ran to their computers to solve this years problem.

The problem was about scheduling a fleet of selfdriving taxis to pick up as many customers on time as possible.

Since the competition only lasts for 3.5 hours, it's important to create a solution that gets a score as fast as possible, to make sure the team has understood the problem correctly.
Many teams in Lund succeeded with this, and submitted within the first hour.

During the last hour the scoreboard is frozen, which builds up a lot of suspense, since almost all teams from Lund submitted improved solutions.
