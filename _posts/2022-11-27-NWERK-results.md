During The Northwestern Europe Regional Contest (NWERC) the last qualifying before ICPC (International Collegiate Programing Contest) Code@lth had tree teams representing Lunds University. Efter traveling down to Delft in the Netherlands and getting settled in during yesturdays test session. 

Durnig the competition ezcp started out hot and kept up the pace with the early leaders. After about two hours ezcp had enhereted the lead. Lunds other two teams had a tougher start with two problems solved each after two hours. ezcp would keep battleing out front and by the time the sccoreboard froze they where one of two teams on 10 solved problems with over a 100 minutes lead. noobs@lth and ECON 101 both performed very well at 50:th and 65:th place. As the time ticked down the nerves were runnig high at camp code@lth, were ezcp going to win, could they bring home the title? by the point the time ran out there where only 5 other teams that had the possebility to beat ezcp. During the last hour ECON 101 managed to solve one and placed to finish in 67:th place over all. noobs@lth solved 2 problems during the last hour and finished in 42:nd place but all eyes where on ezcp - did they win. With only tree teams score not comple ezcp were still in the lead but Trinity's Trinity from univerity of Camebridge hade solved the impervius problem F after 16 tries. And with the team fron Denmark not able to solve problem A all was on the table. If ezcp had solved problem F they would be the winners but unfortunatly it wasn't to be. They finished in secund place but they qualifyed for ICPC. A huge achievement! A massive congratulations for all teams from Lund who preformed incredibly well and deservedly so.

Now it is time to go home and practice for next years edition.
