The 28th of February it's time for Google Hash Code once again (17:30 - 22:30)!
This is the fourth time Code@LTH organizes a hub for Google Hash Code - an annual world wide team programming competition.

Location for the presentation will be E:1406, then we will be in the group rooms around E:1406.

For more live info, see our [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1004230436433297).

To participate you will have to sign up here: [https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode).

Don't forget to mark Code@LTH as your hub when you create your team on the judge system.

Last year the problem was about scheduling uber drives in a city grid so that as many passengers were picked up on time as possible. 

## Todo-list for participants
- Sign up at: [https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode)
- Mark yourself as attending at the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1004230436433297)!
- Find 3 friends (or fewer, teams of 2-4 are accepted).
- Create your team on the judge-website that you get access to after sign up, and select Code@LTH as your hub.
- Spread the word! Last year we were about 70 people at our hub, it would be cool with even more this year :D
- Find the hub's schedule here a week before the competition. We plan to meet up about 30-45 min before the contest starts for a short introduction to the competition, some dos and don'ts during the competition and to give away some swag.

### If you are really serious,
Practice with your team! 
- Look at some [old problems](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/archive).
- Use a [template](https://github.com/exoji2e/hashcode-template).

We hope to see you there! :D
