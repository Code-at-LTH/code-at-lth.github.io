The 28th of February it's time for Google Hash Code once again (17:00 - 22:00)!
This is the fourth time Code@LTH organizes a hub for Google Hash Code - an annual world wide team programming competition.

Location for the presentation will be E:1406, then we will be in the group rooms around E:1406.

For more live info, see our [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1004230436433297).

To participate you will have to sign up here: [https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode)
Don't forget to mark Code@LTH as your hub when you create your team on the judge system.

Last year the problem was about scheduling uber drives in a city grid so that as many passengers were picked up on time as possible. 

Here is a list of what you should do if you'd like to join:
- Sign up at: [https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode)
- Mark yourself as attending this event!
- Find 3 friends (or fewer, teams of 2-4 are accepted)
- Create your team on the judge page that you get access to after sign up, and select Code@LTH as your hub.
- Spread the word! Last year we were about 70 people at our hub, it would be cool with even more this year :D
- Find the hub's schedule here a week before the competition. We plan to meet up about 30-45 min before the contest starts for a short introduction to the competition, some dos and don'ts during the competition and to give away some swag.

We hope to see you there! :D
