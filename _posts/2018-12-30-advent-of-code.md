The advent calendar [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) has come to an end!

Every day between the 1st and 25th of December a puzzle has been released, which you are supposed to solve as fast as possible. For most of the problems you need to code a small script. Each puzzle is divided in two parts, where you get a star for each part you solve.

In total Code@LTH gained 724 stars with 30 participants!

You gain global points if you are one of the first 100 globally to solve a puzzle. If your rank on the global leader board is `r` you gain `max(0, 100-r)` global points. There are about 60000 persons who have solved the first puzzle, and 1800 who have solved the 25th. In general it is quite hard to gain global points. 6 members on the Code@LTH leader board managed to snatch some global points, congratulations!

You can still access and solve the problems at [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/). We hope to see you participate next year!
